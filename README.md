### Running the Project

To start the Expo development server:

```
This command will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. From there, you can:

- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device (iOS or Android) to run the app directly on your phone.

Once the Expo Go app launches your project, the video player component will be displayed. The application is set up to play the sample.mp4 video and utilize the subtitles.ass file located within the project's asset structure. Interact with the custom controls to play, pause, and manage video playback and subtitle visibility.
